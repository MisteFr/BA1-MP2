We have adhered to the suggested architecture without significant additions.

## Extensions

As part of the extensions, we added menus (PauseMenu and GameOverMenu) that are sub-classes of ICWarsArea.
For the Pause Menu to work, we added a new GameState 'PAUSED'.
requestResume requestPause
isPause

We added a getDistance method too.
We added a playSound function to in ICWars that allow us to play sounds.
## Nota Bene

As the total size of the archive was too big, we had to submit our ressources folder the switchtube drive under the name
"324366-344200-ressources.zip", as asked by Ms Sam.
